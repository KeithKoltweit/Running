            <h2>The importance of right equipment</h2>
            <p>The beauty of running is in its simplicity. All you really need is a good pair of shoes. Go to a
                specialty running store where trained professionals will evaluate your feet, watch you run, recommend
                the right shoes, and then let you go out for a test drive. You'll leave with a comfortable pair of shoes
                that will have you running pain and injury free.</p>
            <p>If you're just a gear junkie, we have listed other items many runners prefer for the time of year and
                even your first race. We recommend starting out small again, best not to sink in a lot of money if
                running just isn't for you after all. Just remember to do your research on products, we wouldn't want
                the gear to hinder you results.</p>

                <h3>Shoes</h3>
                <img src="images/shoe.jpg" alt="">
                <p>A good pair of running shoes is a must. Running shoes not only provide substantial midsole foot
                    cushioning, they also offer arch support, aid in the prevention of inujuries and can promote
                    improved athletic performance.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="summerGear">
                <h3>Running Tee</h3>
                <img src="images/shirt.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Perhaps the two most importan qualities of a good running shirt are wicking ability and drying time.
                    Wicking is the process of transfering moisture or sweat away from your body through tiny spaces
                    within
                    the weave of the fabric and then dispersing it to the outer layer to evaporate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="summerGear">
                <h3>Running Shorts</h3>
                <img src="images/shorts.jpg" alt="">
                <p>It may seem silly, but they do make shorts just for running. There are many different styles of
                    running
                    shorts available. These shorts offer an excellent range of motion and prevent chafing. Once you
                    start
                    researching what type will best meet your need, you'll find they come in various lengths. Each
                    length
                    will serve a purpose and should pick one based on your goals</p>
            </div>

            <!-- <h2>Winter Training Gear</h2> -->
            <div class="winterGear">
                <h3>Running Tights</h3>
                <img src="images/longPants.jpg" alt="">
                <p>To maintain peak performance during the winter months rely on working with the body's response to
                    temperature. Research has shown cold muscles perform worse and fatigue quicker. We recommend
                    dressing in layers, as your temperature will rise quickly. A great pair of running tights can make
                    all the difference.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="winterGear">
                <h3>Long Sleeve Compression</h3>
                <img src="images/longShirt.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The same principals apply to long tee running shirts and with pants. Dress in layers that are easy to
                    remove and lightweight. You will heat up quick but it is important to start out a little warm so
                    your muscles don't fatigue or perform badly. We recommend material that will wick away moisture.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="winterGear">
                <h3>Beanie</h3>
                <img src="images/beanie.jpg" alt="">
                <p>A good beanie can keep your head nice and warm, and that, in turn will keep the rest of your body
                    warm and comfortable during each of your runs. In order to ensure that heat is retained, cold
                    weather gear needs to incorporate high-performing thermal capabilitites.</p>

            <!-- <h2 style=>Racing Gear</h2> -->
            <div class="raceGear">
                <h3>Racing Belt</h3>
                <img src="images/belt.jpg" alt="">
                <p>These are a must have on race day. Gives you the ability to carry small water bottles and snacks
                    along your race path. While the course will have aid stations set up along the way, the selection is
                    not always the best. This way you can eat or drink something when you need that extra boost. Many
                    options available, pick the one that won't be cumbersome or to small it doesn't fit anything.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="raceGear">
                <h3>Smart Watch</h3>
                <img src="images/watch.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Another must have item to make your race day even better. While many options of smart watches are out
                    there they all do the same thing, record that time. Great way to take a quick glance and make sure
                    you are on the pace time you want.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="raceGear">
                <h3>Shoes</h3>
                <img src="images/shoe.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Shoes are so important that we put them on here twice. Remember, you want to race in the same pair
                    you have been training with. While it might be tempting to get a fresh pair, DON'T. Running shoes
                    have a break in period. If you do want to get a new pair we recommend running with them before your
                    race day and break them in properly</p>
