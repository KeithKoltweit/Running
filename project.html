            <h3>Functions, if else statements, Working within the DOM</h3>
            <p>Javascript added to my training page is doing a couple things here. First, I set up functions that work
                with buttons to show and hide tables. Working with css, all the tables are hidden until a button is
                clicked. I set up an event listener to react when that button is clicked. Only once that button is
                clicked will it show the related table. The tables data if gathered by a query selector for each of the
                5 tables. Second, I have other functions that pull values from the html by Id. These values get tested
                with if/else statements to display an appropriate message.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Functions, Loops, Arrays</h3>
            <p>This page works similar to the Training page with a few modifications. The same concepts are being used
                as the training page but this time I set up objects that hold arrays for the data. This will get pushed
                to the html page of Races Near You. I have a for loop that gets information from the arrays in the
                object with a length property. I have variables that look for Ids in this page and use inner.html to
                attatch the information to a table.</p>

            <h3>jQuery</h3>
            <p>I used javascript on my Gear page that uses jQuery to display images and text related to the items for
                various events. The jQuery I decided to use here was a fade in and fade out. When a button is clicked it
                takes the previous image/images and fades them out and fades in the new pictures and text for that
                button.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>jQuery and Forms & Validation</h3>
            <p>I have javascript on my Contact Us page to validate information the user types in or doesn't put in. If a
                field if required and the user doesn't supply that information and clicks the submit button a message
                will appear in red telling them that they missed a that field with an appropriate message on the top of
                the form. I also, decided to use jQuery to show the user what field they are on with focus that changes
                the background color. Then if the user clicks away from a required field I have blur property that
                changes the background color to red, showing that they need to fill out that field.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>if/else statement, Variables and data types, Comparison operators, jQuery</h3>
            <p>Back in the Training page I used javascript to take values in from the inputs and add them up. I then
                used if else statements to show how many miles a person ran (actual) then compare that to a preset
                number (goal). I have a blank id span element to fill in what the user got for the week. I have the
                variables take in the input values that also allow decimal numbers up to 2 spaces.</p>
            <p>Added a last minute jQuery feature. The numbers that get pulled after you click the "check your results"
                button, jQuery changes the text color to the numbers. Runs with an if else statement that checks if a
                goal was reached, green for yes and red for no.</p>
